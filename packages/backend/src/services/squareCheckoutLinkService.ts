/**
 * Square Checkout Link Service -- Square changeover Wave S1 (2026-09-09)
 *
 * Shared choke point for every "give someone a URL to pay later" flow this migration needs:
 * Bounty purchase (synchronous -- NOT this file, see squarePaymentService.ts's
 * createSquareCharge), Auction winner payment, Hold-to-Pay invoice creation
 * (reservationController.ts / posController.ts), and POS QR payment links
 * (posController.ts's createPaymentLinkInternal). Real architectural finding from the
 * architect's scoping pass (claude_docs/feature-notes/
 * square-changeover-remaining-work-scoping-2026-09-09.md, Section 1.2): Stripe uses TWO
 * different objects for this ("give someone a URL to pay later") -- a Checkout Session for
 * HoldInvoice, a Payment Link for POSPaymentLink -- but Square has exactly ONE primitive for
 * both, `CreatePaymentLink` (Square's Checkout API, Quick Pay Checkout mode). This file wraps
 * that single primitive so every future caller shares one implementation instead of five
 * separate ad-hoc Square integrations.
 *
 * Confirmed against the live SDK source this session (square@45.1.0, the version pinned in
 * packages/backend/package.json) -- NOT assumed from older docs/examples -- via
 * unpkg.com/square@45.1.0: `client.checkout.paymentLinks.create/update/delete` is a real,
 * currently-shipped nested resource client (api/resources/checkout/resources/paymentLinks/
 * client/Client.d.ts). `CreatePaymentLinkRequest.quickPay` takes `{ name, priceMoney,
 * locationId }`; `CheckoutOptions.appFeeMoney` is the Square analog of Stripe's
 * `application_fee_amount` (requires PAYMENTS_WRITE_ADDITIONAL_RECIPIENTS scope -- already on
 * SQUARE_OAUTH_SCOPES per squareConnectService.ts); `DeletePaymentLinkResponse` confirms
 * deleting a link cancels its underlying Order (`cancelledOrderId`), matching the architect's
 * finding that this is the direct equivalent of
 * `stripe().paymentLinks.update({ active: false })`.
 *
 * DELIBERATE DESIGN CHOICE -- token resolution lives INSIDE this service, not the caller:
 * unlike squarePaymentService.ts's createSquareCharge (which takes an already-resolved
 * organizerAccessToken + locationId because it only ever had 2 callers), this service will
 * gain 5 callers across Wave S2 (bounty is NOT one of them -- bounty is synchronous
 * CreatePayment, not a checkout link). Centralizing the organizer lookup +
 * resolveOrganizerSquareAccessToken() call here once, instead of duplicating that boilerplate
 * in every future call site, is the whole point of building this as a shared file. The
 * SquareOnboardingIncompleteError fail-closed contract is unchanged and still exported from
 * squarePaymentService.ts -- callers catch it exactly the same way squarePaymentController.ts
 * already does today.
 *
 * SQUARE HAS NO METADATA FIELD ON A PAYMENT LINK: confirmed via the live
 * CreatePaymentLinkRequest type -- there is no arbitrary key/value metadata field anywhere on
 * PaymentLink or CreatePaymentLinkRequest. The closest available hook is `paymentNote`
 * (<=500 chars, attached to the resulting Payment once paid -- same field
 * squarePaymentService.ts's createSquareCharge already truncates at 500 for its analogous
 * `note` parameter). `metadata` below is therefore a BEST-EFFORT, lossy passthrough encoded
 * into `paymentNote` as `key=value;key=value` -- it is NOT a substitute for real correlation.
 * Callers that need durable correlation must key off the returned `paymentLinkId`/`orderId`
 * and their own DB row (HoldInvoice/POSPaymentLink), not this note.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, NOT FIXED HERE (flagged for Wave S2, out of scope for this dispatch): Purchase's
 * existing idempotency backstop is a compound partial unique index on
 * `(stripePaymentIntentId, itemId)` (see holdInvoicePaymentRecorder.ts /
 * posPaymentLinkRecorder.ts). A SQUARE-processor Purchase row never populates
 * stripePaymentIntentId (only squarePaymentId), so that constraint does NOT backstop a
 * concurrent double-record race for a Square-paid sale the way it does for Stripe today. A
 * matching partial unique index on `(squarePaymentId, itemId)` is a real follow-up schema
 * change once Wave S2 actually wires Square payments through these recorders for real
 * traffic -- not made here per this dispatch's explicit "no schema.prisma edits" constraint.
